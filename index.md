### Requirements

Author Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.
*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of R and Rstudio.
We'll work through software installation during the first day.
