### Requirements

Author Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.
*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of R and Rstudio.

R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration,
visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use RStudio.
For this workshop you'll need to install both R (version 3.4.3 or newer) and
RStudio on your computer. Please follow these installation instructions before coming to the workshop

#### Windows
Install R by downloading and running this
[.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) file from CRAN. 
Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" 
instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

#### macOS
Install R by downloading and running this
[.pkg](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) file from CRAN. Also, 
please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

#### Linux
You can download the binary files for your distribution from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package 
manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for 
Fedora run sudo dnf install R). Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

### Workshop Files

You also need to [download some files](data.zip) for this workshop.
Extract this folder and put it on your desktop.  This is where we will be
working throughout the workshop.
