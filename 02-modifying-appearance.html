Document Sections
</h2>
<p>
We have several sections in our document; it would be nice if these were listed in a table of contents and numbered so we could easily refer to a specific section. We don’t want to have to manually update the table of contents or renumber everything when we move sections around; we want knitr to do as much as possible auto-magically.
</p>
<p>
In order to customize the appearance of our document, we need to pass information to knitr about what we want. We use the YAML header, where we customized the title and author, in order to set specific options.
</p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents">
Table of Contents
</h3>
<p>
In the YAML we have a number of output formats. You’ll notice when you change the knitr output format that the format you’re interested in moves to the top of the list. We can make customizations to the format by removing the word <code>default</code> after the format and including an indented list of options. If we want to include a table of contents, we add the option <code>toc: yes</code> to both the <code>word_document</code> and <code>html_document</code> formats. Then use the knit button to see the results.
</p>
<h3 id="section-numbers-and-formatting">
Section Numbers and Formatting
</h3>
<p>
Section numbering is where the behavior of different output formats (such as HTML versus Word) starts to diverge. To add section numbers to our HTML document we just need to add the option <code>number_sections: yes</code>. We can also have the TOC appear as a document sidebar by adding <code>toc_float: yes</code> to our html document options.
</p>
<p>
For the Word document, section numbering is controlled by a Word style document. Instructions for creating the Word style document are included as an optional exercise below.
</p>
<h2 id="document-themes-and-custom-formatting">
Document Themes and Custom Formatting
</h2>
<h3 id="html">
HTML
</h3>
<p>
The <code>knitr</code> package supports built-in themes that format the overall document. <a href="https://bootswatch.com/3/">Click here to view available themes</a>. At the time of this writing, the following themes are confirmed to work with Rmarkdown and knitr: “default”, “cerulean”, “journal”, “flatly”, “readable”, “spacelab”, “united”, “cosmo”, “lumen”, “paper”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, and “yeti”.
</p>
<p>
You can control which theme is used for the document by adding <code>theme: readable</code> in the indented portion of the <code>html_document</code> section of the YAML metadata. Try switching our a different theme and see what happens!
</p>
<p>
These themes are built using standard web Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). If we don’t like how any of the built in themes look, we can add a CSS style sheet to make specific changes. In our exercise file document, the quoted text looks too big; the font is larger than the surrounding text! We’ll control this oddity with a style sheet. We’ve provided one for this exercise, so let’s view <code>custom.css</code> in your file directory to see what it looks like.
</p>
<p>
This style sheet edits the spacing and font size of all the quotes in the document. You can then apply this style to your HTML output by adding the line <code>css: custom.css</code> to your YAML header.
</p>
<h3 id="word-optional-step-if-time-allows">
Word (<em>Optional step if time allows</em>)
</h3>
<p>
You can customize Word document styling, such as fonts, sizing, and section numbering, within the Word program. You can then provide <code>knitr</code> with the stylized Word document to use as a style sheet of sorts . Because editing word document styling is a pain, we’ve created a Word document with section numbering that you can use. You just need to add <code>reference_docx: “Base_2013_style.docx”</code> to the YAML header for the <code>word_document</code> type and knit to see the result.
</p>
<h2 id="integrated-code">
Integrated Code
</h2>
<h3 id="dates">
Dates
</h3>
<p>
We can have R automatically populate dates based on the date we knit the document. The ‘insert_dates.txt’ file has code snippets that use the function <code>Sys.Date()</code> to get the date from your computer. The first line is a section of code enclosed in <code>"</code> (double quotation marks) for the YAML header (all values in the YAML header use double quotes). Kint the document and you see that this small snippet of code is executed and the date appears. There are two additional code lines that include just a single <code>backtick that signified a small code chunk. These can be just one line, and don’t have the control of the three backtick code chunks we learned earlier. Knit your document and you’ll see the dates appear in place of these code chunks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="file-information"&gt;File information&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can use inline code chunks to populate information from our data file.&lt;br /&gt; Add this text under Data Collected: The &lt;code&gt;doaj_seal.csv&lt;/code&gt; file currently contains</code>r nrow(doaj_seal)` reputable open access journals.
</p>
<h3 id="plots">
Plots
</h3>
<p>
The benefit of using Rstudio to author reports is that you have the ability to perform computation, live within the document. First, let’s load some data into our exercise file. Look at the top of the file where the DOAJ data is imported in a code chunk. Code chunks are demarcated by three tics ```. The first group of tics is followed by a label that indicates the type of code and a description. So, the label in this example is <code>{r add_dataset}</code>. You’ll see RStudio makes pretty formatting around the code chunk. There are options for each chunk, and you can run the code by clicking the green arrow. Then you press the arrow, you’ll notice an output message and a change in the right ‘Environment’ section of RStudio. The message is the output from the operation, and the right panel shows that the data file has been loaded. You can hide the output message by clicking on the up arrow or modifying the options so that <code>message=FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s add a new code chunk that will do something fun! At the bottom of the ‘Project Description’ add a new code chunk with the label <code>{r plot_country,echo= TRUE,fig.width=10,fig.height=11}</code>
</p>
<p>
Open <code>insert_plot1.txt</code> and copy the code to the body of the code chunk.
</p>
<p>
Hit the green button and you’ll see a plot appear, generated by the <code>ggplot2</code> package. When you knit the document, this code will also execute and place a plot in the document.
</p>
<p>
We can do the same thing to generate additional plots. Add the code from <code>insert_plot2.txt</code> with the label ‘plot_license’ before the “Metadata” section.
</p>
<h2 id="references">
References
</h2>
<p>
References are another area of document preparation where automation is really helpful. References in knitr are handled with BibTex files (.bib). BibTex is a reasonably standard format that can be produced by most reference managers and online services. We’ve provided the bibliography <code>oajournals.bib</code> file for you to work with during this course. There is an entire section of the YAML header called <code>bibliography</code> that handles references . You then provide knitr with the name of the BibTex file, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>bibliography:
- oajournals.bib</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s open our <code>oajournals.bib</code> file and see what it looks like. You’ll see citation information about each article in groups indicated by a document type tag, e.g., <code><span class="citation" data-cites="article">@article</span></code>, followed by a unique citation key (typically the last name of an author and the year of publication, e.g. Castro_2017), followed by citation information. If you look at the exercise document, you’ll note that all of the citations have thus far been written manually (e.g., Castro et al (2017)). We’ll want to replace them by machine readable code that knitr will be able to combine into a Reference List at the end of the report. We use the @ symbol to indicate a reference, so replace each reference with the appropriate tag, for example <code><span class="citation" data-cites="Castro_2017">@Castro_2017</span></code>. If the author’s name already appears in the text, you can shorten the inline citation by placing a hyphen before the key.
</p>
<p>
At knit time, the reference list is automatically added to the end of the document under the “References” section, so we can now delete the dummy references that were there.
</p>
<p>
The citation style defaults to Chicago. If you want a different citation style, you can download a csl style file from the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles">Zotero style registry</a>. We’ve included an Americal Chemical Society CSL file in the data directory. You add the citation style file by using the csl section of the YAML (this is a new section, like bibliography):
</p>
<pre><code>csl: american-chemical-society.csl</code></pre>
<p>
After knitting, you’ll see the citation style change.
</p>
<h2 id="embedded-sub-documents-and-math">
Embedded Sub-Documents and Math
</h2>
<p>
Up to now, we’ve been writing our report in one Rmarkdown document. We can actually build our document from sub-documents that knitr will integrate into the output. The sub-documents (aka child documents) do not have to contain a complete YAML header because they are designed to be integrated into the ‘main document’ or ‘parent’ at knit time.
</p>
<p>
To see how this works, find a document in your folder called <code>equations-child.Rmd</code>. You can see that this file has a minimal header followed by some Rmarkdown text. You’ll also see some equations written in LaTeX. That’s right; you can write LaTeX within an RMarkdown document and it will get correctly formatted at knit time.
</p>
<p>
Let’s add the child document at the end of the “Project Description” section. You add child documents with a code chunk, and include the document location in the label, for example: <code>{r equations, child = “equations-child.Rmd”}</code>.
</p>
<p>
When you knit you get nicely formatted equation in both HTML and Word.
</p>
<p>
Using multiple child-documents is a convenient and tidy way to manage multiple sections in a single long report. Each section can be authored and tested seperately without bogging <code>knitr</code> down with one long scrolling document. Additionally, if just one section needs to be changed or updated over time, the parent-child authoring approach isolates the change to the necessary file without opening (and possibly introducing errors inadvertenly) to the longer parent.
